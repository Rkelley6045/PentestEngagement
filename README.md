## ***GoodSecurity Penetration Test Report***

#### ***07/28/2021*** 


### ***1. High-Level Summary*** 

GoodSecurity was tasked with performing an internal penetration test on GoodCorp’s CEO, Hans Gruber. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. The goal of this test is to perform attacks similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Hans’ computer to determine if it is at risk. GoodSecurity’s overall objective was to exploit any vulnerable software, find a secret recipe file on Hans’ computer, and report the findings back to GoodCorp.
The internal penetration test found several alarming vulnerabilities on Hans’ computer: When performing the attacks, GoodSecurity was able to gain access to his machine and find the secret recipe file by exploiting two programs with major vulnerabilities. The details of the attack are below.


### ***2. Findings*** 
#### ****Machine IP:**** 

192.168.0.20

#### ****Hostname:**** 

MSEDGEWIN10

#### ****Vulnerability Exploited:**** 

exploit/windows/http/icecast_header (Icecast Header Overwrite)

#### ****Vulnerability Explanation:**** 

The buffer overflow vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to a failure of the application to propertly enforce boundary conditions when dealing with user-supplied input data. For example, an attaacker can intentionally feed input that the buffer cannot store, and overwrite areas that hold executable code, replacing it with their own code. This vulnerability is reported to only be exploitable to execute remote code on Microsoft Windows platforms in the context of the Icecast server.

#### ****Severity:**** 

High 7 out of 10


#### ****Proof of Concept:**** 

Please refer to the following link for a step-by-step break down of how I accessed the target's (CEO's) workstation and obtained access to the CEO's user.secretfile.txt file and my exfiltration of the Drinks.recipe.txt file from the target's workstation.

### ****3. Recommendations**** 

Install the latest version of Icecast (v. 2.0.2 and up) and all other software.
